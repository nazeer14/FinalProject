He later reprised his role in its sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), which became the first Indian film ever to gross over ₹1,000 crore (US$155 million) in all languages in just ten days and is the second-highest-grossing Indian film to date, helping Prabhas achieve international recognition.[10][11] He then starred in the pan-Indian action thriller Saaho (2019).
            
            Prabhas is the first South Indian actor to receive a wax sculpture at Madame Tussaud's wax museum.[12] In addition to his film career, he is widely known for promoting various humanitarian and philanthropic causes. He is the brand ambassador for the Mahindra TUV300.
            
            Early life and education
            Prabhas was born into a Telugu-speaking family to film producer Uppalapati Surya Narayana Raju and Siva Kumari in Madras, Tamil Nadu. The youngest of three children, he has a elder brother, Prabodh, and elder sister, Pragathi.[3][13][14] He is the nephew of Telugu film actor Krishnam Raju.[3] His family hails from Mogalthur, near Bhimavaram of West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh.[15]

            Career
            2002–2011: Debut and breakthrough

            Prabhas started his film career with Eeswar (2002). In 2003, he was the lead in Raghavendra.
            
            In 2004, he appeared in Varsham and Adavi Raamudu. He received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the former.
            
            In 2005, he appeared in Chakram and in the film Chatrapathi, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, in which he portrays the role of a refugee, exploited by goons. It had a 100-day run in 54 centers.[19] Idlebrain.com stated that he had a unique style and macho charm in his screen presence.[20] Chatrapathi earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.
            
            Later, he starred in the dance drama Pournami (2006), the action film Yogi (2007) and the action drama Munna (2007). This was followed by the action-comedy Bujjigadu in 2008. In 2009, his two films were Billa and Ek Niranjan. Indiaglitz called Billa "stylish and visually rich".[21] Ek Niranjan earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.
            
            In 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews upon release. The Times of India gave a 2.5 star rating explaining "Director Karunakaran extracts good performances from his actors, but can't come up with a refreshing plot. It looks like the director hasn't really come out of his Tholi Prema hangover as he dishes out yet another one-sided love saga but fails to come up with a valid and logical reason to make a GenZ lad to hold back his feelings for his lover until the last moment. However, he compensates it all, by adding loads of fun moments in the film and the screenplay does have its share of some touching moments."[22]
            
            In 2011, he appeared in another romantic comedy Mr. Perfect. The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and noted "The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the intention of the makers must be appreciated.[23] His performance in the film earned him his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.
            
            2012–2014: Continued career
            In 2012, Prabhas starred in Rebel, an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence. Sashidhar from The Times of India stated, "The film belongs to hard-core Prabhas fans as the movie is stylish and visually rich but not much in content".[24] Purnima Ranawat from NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for the mass audience. The film will be definitely liked by Prabhas' fans. Watch it for the dancing talent of Tamannaah and action skills of Prabhas."[25] Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave the movie 1.5 stars out of five and said, "Working with hardly any storyline, director Raghava Lawrence had made a film that is arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for the masses and certainly not for the discerning audience."[26] He also rendered voice for a short cameo for the film Denikaina Ready (2012).[27]
            
            In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi. Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that "First half of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episodes which occupies the lion's share of the second half is good. Climax could have been better. The plus points of the film are Prabhas, music and all-round orientation. On a whole, Mirchi has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler".[28] Mahesh S Koneru gave his verdict that "At the box office, the film will turn in a good commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5.[29] Way2movies also gave a rating of 3.25/5, giving the verdict that "Prabhas rocks the show in this decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer".[30] SuperGoodMovies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both class and mass. It is a worth watch."[31] His performance in the film earned him his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He then made his Hindi cinema debut in 2014 in the item number "Punjabi Mast" from the film Action Jackson.[32]
            
            2015–2017: Baahubali and pan-India films

            In 2015, Prabhas appeared as Shivudu/Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali in S.S. Rajamouli's epic action drama Baahubali: The Beginning which is the fourth-highest-grossing Indian film to date.[33][34][35] The film started a new film movement named pan-India films. Prabhas reprised his role in its sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), which became the first Indian film ever to gross over ₹1,000 crore (US$155 million) in all languages in just ten days, and is the second-highest-grossing Indian film to date.[36][37][38] He won the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in The Conclusion.[39] He increased his weight to 105 kg for Baahubali's character.[40] His performance in both film earned him his sixth and seventh nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.
            
            The success of Baahubali has propelled Prabhas to become a pan-Indian actor, receiving significant following in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi languages.[41][42]
            
            2018-present: Career fluctuations

It received negative reviews from the critics and turned out to be another box-office failure for Prabhas.[48]

            As of August 2023, Prabhas has four films under various stages of production.[49] The first of which is the Prashanth Neel-directed action film Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire.[50] The next is Nag Ashwin's epic mythological sci-fi film, Kalki 2898 AD, starring alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Deepika Padukone, and Disha Patani.[51]
